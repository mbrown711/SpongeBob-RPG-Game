Documentation, source code, and instructions on how to set up and run the game are located in the folder Project1Spongebob. If you're not sure if you have Python installed on your machine, you can check by opening a terminal/cmd window and entering `python3 --version`. If you don't have Python installed on your machine, you can download from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-375/).


This was a project for our Python Programming class while at Pace. We needed to create a game using what we had learned at the time. The game is a "choose your own adventure" style game based off of SpongeBob SquarePants. The project is treated as a whole development cycle, meaning, it will include a plan, the source code, bug reports, documentation, testing, etc.
